# Habflash
The easy way to use Adobe Flash Player, just like you used to.

With Adobe Flash Player coming up for it's planned end-of-life at the end of [December 31st, 2020][1].

# Heads up!
> HabFlash will no longer work after Tuesday, 12 January 2021 due to it's complied with a version of Adobe Flash that includes the Kill Switch. [Maxthon Nitro][15] is a really lightweight browser that uses an older version of Adobe Flash Player and is a decent alternative if you're looking for something to use in the meantime. We only recommend using this for retros and not personal use due to Nitro is no longer maintained and the security risks of out-dated Adobe Flash Player.

### How does Habflash work?
Habflash is built in JavaScript and has been tested on [Microsoft Windows][2] and [macOS][3].

Habflash uses [Chromium][4], the same browser technology used by [Google Chrome][4], so your websites should all load effectively as they did before. The software is relatively lightweight and can be easily added or removed from your system.

The address bar and tabbed interface make it easy for you to switch seamlessly between different applications and websites.
